# Python_Django_Project
I use Python-Django for the first time, usually i use Python only with my RaspberryPi but here i would like create backend site with Django and perhaps because :
PHP is dead ..., or Not! :o

but i think that is not a good idea to used PHP as the only and first backend language
But as there are a lot, i prefer try Django at the moment !!!
