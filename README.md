# Python_Django_Project
I use Python-Django for the first time, usually i use Python only with my RaspberryPi but here i would like create backend site with Django.

but i think that is not a good idea to used PHP as the only and first backend language
But as there are a lot, i prefer try Django at the moment because i already use python for others projects, While learning php/mySQL !!!
